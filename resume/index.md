This is a bitmap of a representation of me, in real life I'm more like, three-dimensional.  

## About
### Hello, my name is J. Alfonso Mozko H., I am a multi-talented human with interdisciplinary education.

You can also call me a developer, or a web designer, or a computer scientist, or a computer sorcerer, or a consultant. However, I don't like to define myself by the work I've done.

Fueled by high energy levels (sushi and soda sometimes) and boundless enthusiasm, I'm easily inspired and more than willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me.
I'm a passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and learn. I'm never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.

My energy levels propel me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I'm a fast learner, able to acquire new skills and juggle different projects and roles.

I am interested in developing expertise in multiple areas throughout my life and career. I currently work remotely as a consultant for a supply chain company and with a selected freelance client base, I am open to new opportunities.
