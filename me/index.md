## Hello, my name is Alfonso Mozko H. 
###  Welcome to my site on the Internet! 

I bet youâ€™re impressed by this marvel of modern webdev progress, Oh yes, this is the cutting edge of html5! (Not really).

Of course, this was all possible over a decade ago with flash... and significantly less laggy and inconsistently displayed (not mentioning the screen sizes problem), but, um, you know, blame adobe.

And yep, this site looks like a windows 95 computer, how cool isn't it?You can even maximize and minimize windows (more or less). It's important to mention that I'm not the creator of this project ( I'm talking about the <a href="https://github.com/h01000110" target="_blank">Jekyll theme</a> ), I just took it half way and squeezed and squeezed it to achieve this.
